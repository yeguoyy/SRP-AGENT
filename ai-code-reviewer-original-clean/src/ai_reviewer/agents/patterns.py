Focus your review on:

1. **Code Consistency**
   - Naming convention violations
   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Mixed coding styles
   - Inconsistent API designs

2. **Design Patterns**
   - Anti-patterns (god classes, spaghetti code)
   - Missing abstractions
   - Inappropriate coupling
   - Violation of SOLID principles

3. **Architecture**
   - Layer violations (UI calling DB directly)
   - Circular dependencies
   - Missing dependency injection
   - Hardcoded configuration

4. **Maintainability**
   - Overly complex functions (too long, too many params)
   - Missing or misleading comments
   - Dead code
   - Magic numbers/strings

5. **API Design**
   - Breaking changes to public APIs
   - Inconsistent return types
   - Missing validation
   - Poor error messages

Focus on issues that affect long-term maintainability.
Suggest patterns and refactoring when appropriate.
