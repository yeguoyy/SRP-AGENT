## Overview

AI Code Reviewer takes a different approach to automated code review: instead of relying on a single model, it orchestrates **multiple specialized agents** that review code from different perspectives — security, performance, and code quality — then combines their findings into a unified, confidence-scored review.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Run 2–5+ LLM agents in parallel, each with a specialized focus area
- **Consensus-Based Scoring**: Findings are weighted by how many agents agree, reducing false positives
- **Anthropic Messages API**: All models (Claude Sonnet 5, Haiku 4.5) accessed directly via the official `anthropic` SDK, streamed via `messages.stream`, with prompt caching, JSON-schema structured output, and tool use
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatic PR reviews via webhooks, with inline comments and thread resolution
- **Incremental Reviews**: Delta tracking detects new, fixed, and open findings across pushes — with convergence logic that stops reviewing when findings stabilize
- **Documentation Review**: Rule-based check that flags missing doc updates on architecture-impacting PRs — works out-of-the-box on any repo by probing for `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and architecture folders (zero LLM cost)

For the full technical deep-dive — pipeline flowcharts, scoring formulas, convergence state machine, and prompt engineering — see the **[Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install ai-code-reviewer

# Export credentials
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...

# Review a GitHub PR
ai-reviewer review-pr calimero-network/core 123

# Review a local diff
git diff main | ai-reviewer review --output markdown
```

## How It Works

All LLM agents call Anthropic's Messages API directly via the official `anthropic` SDK. Security, performance, patterns, and logic agents run on `claude-sonnet-5` (security and logic with adaptive extended thinking on); the style agent uses `claude-haiku-4-5`. Repo exploration happens through Claude tool use (`read_file` / `glob` / `grep`) backed by the GitHub Contents API — no cloning, no extra infrastructure.

        A5["Haiku\n(Style)"]
    end

```

## Configuration

Create `config.yaml`:

```yaml
anthropic:
  api_key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
  default_model: claude-sonnet-5
  enable_prompt_caching: true
  max_combined_context_tokens: 80000

github:
  token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}  # or Classic PAT for thread resolution (see below)

agents:
  - name: security-reviewer
    model: claude-sonnet-5
    focus_areas: [security, architecture]

  - name: performance-reviewer
    model: claude-sonnet-5
    focus_areas: [performance, logic]

  - name: style-reviewer
    model: claude-haiku-4-5
    focus_areas: [style, readability]
    allow_tool_use: false

orchestrator:
  timeout_seconds: 300
  min_agents_required: 2

# Documentation review (rule-based, no LLM cost)
doc_review:
  enabled: true
  architecture_paths: ["architecture/", "docs/", "doc/"]
  convention_files: ["AGENTS.md", "CLAUDE.md", "CONTRIBUTING.md"]
```

## Local Review (before a PR exists)

Run the same multi-agent pipeline against uncommitted work, from inside a Claude
Code session - no API key and nothing posted to GitHub. Reviewers are subagents in
your session; clustering, consensus scoring, confidence floors and fix validation
stay in Python, so local and PR reviews apply the same rules.

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/calimero-network/ai-code-reviewer
```

```
/plugin marketplace add calimero-network/ai-code-reviewer
/plugin install ai-review@calimero
```

```bash
/ai-review                 # uncommitted changes, including untracked files
/ai-review --staged        # the index only
/ai-review --base main     # main...HEAD
```

Setup, scopes, configuration and the non-session CLI workflow: **[Local Review](docs/LOCAL-REVIEW.md)**.

## Repository Configuration

Add `.ai-reviewer.yaml` to the root of any reviewed repository to customize behavior:

```yaml
# Exclude generated or vendored files from review
ignore:
  - "**/*.generated.rs"
  - "**/vendor/**"

# Append custom instructions to a specific agent's prompt
agents:
  - name: security-reviewer
    custom_prompt_append: |
      This is a Rust codebase using eyre for errors.
      Flag all unwrap() calls.

# Review policy
policy:
  require_human_review_for: [security]
  block_on_critical: true
```

## GitHub Actions Setup

### Basic Setup (`GITHUB_TOKEN`)

The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by GitHub Actions is sufficient for most features:

- Posting reviews and inline comments
- Adding reactions
- Posting "Resolved" replies

It cannot resolve review threads (collapsing them in the UI), which requires a Classic PAT.

### Full Features (Classic Personal Access Token)

> **Note:** Fine-grained PATs do not support the `resolveReviewThread` GraphQL mutation. Use a Classic PAT with `repo` scope.

1. Create a [Classic Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `repo` scope.

2. Add it as a repository secret named `GH_PAT`:
   ```
   Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
   Name: GH_PAT
   Value: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

3. The workflow uses `GH_PAT` automatically when present, falling back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

For production deployments, prefer a dedicated service account and rotate tokens regularly. GitHub Apps with fine-grained permissions are the recommended long-term approach.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calimero-network/ai-code-reviewer
cd ai-code-reviewer

pip install -e ".[dev]"

pytest
ruff check .
mypy src/
```

## AI Rules & Documentation

The repository ships structured AI context to help coding assistants work with the codebase effectively.

```
.ai/
├── context.md           # Codebase overview — read first
├── doc-bot.md           # Documentation bot instructions
├── prompts/             # Reusable AI prompts
└── rules/               # Per-module design rules
    ├── architecture.md  # High-level design & invariants
    ├── agents.md        # Agent module patterns
    ├── orchestrator.md  # Orchestration rules
    ├── github.md        # GitHub integration patterns
    ├── models.md        # Data model conventions
    └── conventions.md   # Coding style guide
```

The `review-pr` command includes a built-in documentation review that runs alongside the AI code review. It detects architecture-impacting changes (new modules, manifest edits, CI changes, infrastructure files) and checks whether convention files like `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` were updated. For repos with `.ai-reviewer.yaml`, it also checks explicit `source_to_docs_mapping` rules. The check is rule-based (no LLM calls) and posts a separate PR comment with suggestions. Disable with `--no-doc-check` or `doc_review.enabled: false` in config.

### Automatic Doc Update PRs

When stale documentation is detected, the reviewer can automatically generate updated file content and open a PR with the real changes — not just a comment telling you to update them.

**Flow** — a four-stage pipeline (`Understand → Route → Apply → Verify`):
1. Feature PR merges to `main`; CI triggers `ai-reviewer update-docs` on the merge
2. **Understand** — reads the *full* merged PR (title, body, commits, diff) once into a structured change summary (no blind diff truncation)
3. **Route** — maps each change to a doc action: update an existing section, add a new section, or create a new page (honouring `source_to_docs_mapping`)
4. **Apply** — drafts the edits: surgical FIND/REPLACE for HTML, additive sections, or whole new pages wired into `nav.js`/`index.html`
5. **Verify** — a confidence gate; edits that don't reflect the change are **flagged for a human, not shipped**
6. Commits confident updates to a new branch `docs/auto-<sha>` and opens a PR against `main`, assigned to the original PR author. The PR body previews each edited page as a **GitHub-style diff** (added doc text in green, removed in red) so a reviewer sees what changed without opening the raw HTML; flagged docs are listed in their own section. **Nothing auto-merges.**

**Setup: two steps**

1. Enable generation in the repo's `.ai-reviewer.yaml`:

```yaml
documentation:
  enabled: true
  source_to_docs_mapping:
    "src/**": [docs/api.md, README.md]

doc_generation:
  enabled: true
  understanding_model: claude-sonnet-5     # stage 1: full-PR comprehension
  apply_model: claude-haiku-4-5            # stage 3: drafting edits/pages
  allow_new_pages: true                    # may create + wire new pages
  verify_confidence_threshold: medium      # below this, flag for a human
  max_files: 5
```

2. Add a one-line workflow to each repo (calls the shared reusable workflow):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/doc-update.yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
jobs:
  doc-update:
    uses: calimero-network/ai-code-reviewer/.github/workflows/doc-update.yaml@main
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      GH_PAT: ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}
```

No copy-pasted workflow logic — the shared workflow lives in this repo and all repos call it via `uses:`.

**Test locally before wiring up CI:**

```bash
# Preview what would be generated — no PR opened, no files committed
ai-reviewer update-docs calimero-network/auth-frontend 42 --dry-run

# Actually generate and open the PR
ai-reviewer update-docs calimero-network/auth-frontend 42
```

Cost: ~$0.05–0.15 per merge with stale docs (Claude Sonnet, 1–5 files). Zero LLM cost when no stale docs are detected.
