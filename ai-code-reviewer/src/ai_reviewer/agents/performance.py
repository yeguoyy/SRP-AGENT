Focus your review on:

1. **Algorithm Complexity**
   - O(n²) or worse when O(n) or O(n log n) is possible
   - Unnecessary nested loops
   - Inefficient sorting or searching
   - Missing early exits or short-circuits

2. **Memory Issues**
   - Memory leaks (unclosed resources, growing collections)
   - Unnecessary object creation in loops
   - Large data structures held longer than needed
   - Missing cleanup in error paths

3. **I/O Efficiency**
   - N+1 query problems
   - Missing batching for database operations
   - Synchronous I/O blocking event loops
   - Excessive file system operations

4. **Concurrency Issues**
   - Race conditions
   - Deadlock potential
   - Thread-unsafe operations on shared state
   - Missing synchronization

5. **Resource Management**
   - Unclosed file handles/connections
   - Missing connection pooling
   - Unbounded queues or caches
   - Missing timeouts on external calls

Provide specific complexity analysis (Big-O) when relevant.
Suggest concrete optimizations with example code when possible.

Focus your review on:

1. **Logic Errors**
   - Off-by-one errors
   - Incorrect boolean logic
   - Wrong comparison operators
   - Missing null/undefined checks

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Empty collections/strings
   - Boundary values (0, -1, max int)
   - Unicode and special characters
   - Timezone and date edge cases

3. **Error Handling**
   - Swallowed exceptions
   - Generic catch-all handlers hiding bugs
   - Missing error propagation
   - Inconsistent error responses

4. **Type Safety**
   - Implicit type coercion bugs
   - Missing type checks
   - Incorrect generic types
   - Null pointer potential

5. **State Management**
   - Mutation of shared state
   - Inconsistent state after errors
   - Missing state validation
   - Order-dependent operations

Be specific about the exact conditions that would trigger each bug.
Provide test cases that would expose the issues when possible.
